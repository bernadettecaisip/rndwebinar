			leads him in a race against time to prevent the all-powerful Hela from destroying his home world and the 
			Asgardian civilization.
			<br><br>
			Thor returns to Asgard to find Heimdall gone and his estranged brother Loki posing as Odin. After exposing Loki, 
			Thor forces him to help find their father, and with directions from Stephen Strange at the Sanctum Sanctorum in 
			New York City, they locate Odin in Norway. Odin explains that he is dying, Ragnarök is imminent despite Thor's 
			efforts to prevent it, and his passing will free his firstborn child, Hela, from a prison she was sealed in long ago. 
			Hela was the leader of Asgard's armies, conquering the Nine Realms with Odin, but he imprisoned her and wrote her out 
			of history after fearing that she had become too ambitious and powerful.

			When a bank teller discovers he's actually a background player in an open-world video game, he decides to become 
			the hero of his own story -- one that he can rewrite himself. In a world where there's no limits, he's determined 
			to save the day his way before it's too late, and maybe find a little romance with the coder who conceived him.
			<br><br>
			“Free Guy” is like a hyperactive puppy. It really wants to be your friend. It’s easy to like and fun to hang out with. 
			It also has a habit of running around in circles, losing its focus, and shitting on the floor. A family action movie that 
			targets the Fortnite Generation, "Free Guy" also preaches the importance of individuality while not only feeling like a 
			dozen other movies but literally incorporating some of their imagery. An enjoyable cast, including movie-stealing work 
			from Jodie Comer, holds it all together, but one can still see just enough glitches in this matrix to wish it was better.
